# ReactNext
POC on React next for SSR


Steps to get Application running -

1) Run "yarn" to install all npm dependencies
2) Run "yarn start" to start next application

Working -
1) http://localhost:3000 is the url for home page
2) http://localhost:3000/plpWithAppSync is the url for PLP with AppSync

Opening http://localhost:3000/plpWithAppSync in browser directly, renders the PLP Page on Server side and it throws error, but Navigating to PLP page using Header (on top of page) works fine
