# ReactNext
POC on React next for SSR


Steps to get Web running -

1) Run "yarn" to install all npm dependencies
2) Run "yarn start" to start next application

http://localhost:3000 is the url for home page
http://localhost:3000/plpWithAppSync is the url for PLP with AppSync

Navigating to PLP page using Header (on top of page) works fine but when PLP page is rendered on Server then it throws error.
